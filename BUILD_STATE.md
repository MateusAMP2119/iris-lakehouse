# BUILD_STATE

Orchestrator resume file. One line per task: status ∈ {todo, in-progress, done}; done
lines carry the PR link. Epic rows track the development→master checkpoint PR.
Task briefs live in `docs/Tasks/`. Process epics E00 → E12, then E14, then E13.

Worktrees: `../iris-worktrees/EXX.Y` on branch `issue/EXX.Y-short-name`.

RECONCILED 2026-07-07 07:xx: PRs #27 (E03.2 lanes) + #33 (test flake fix) had silently NOT merged despite chains reporting success (API-instability window) — merged into development by hand (commits 6afe150, e131edd); development green, daemon race-clean x3. AUDIT LESSON: verify each merge landed (grep a signature file on origin/development) before marking done; don't trust merge-when-green.sh exit alone.

## E00 Conformance Harness and Traceability Gate — epic PR: #6 (merged)

Post-epic deep review (multi-agent, orchestrator-run per user instruction) produced
review-fix PRs #7 (CI/lint/conformance), #8 (gate hardening, 3 rounds), #9 (exec
runner rebuilt on stdlib os/exec + WaitDelay, 3 rounds) — all reviewed to zero
confirmed findings and merged. Standing rule: every PR gets the Opus pr-review
workflow (.claude/workflows/pr-review.js) before merge; on stall, kill + restart on
Opus, never downgrade.
