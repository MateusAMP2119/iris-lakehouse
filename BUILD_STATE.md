# BUILD_STATE

Orchestrator resume file. One line per task: status ∈ {todo, in-progress, done}; done
lines carry the PR link. Epic rows track the development→master checkpoint PR.
Task briefs live in `docs/Tasks/`. Process epics E00 → E12, then E14, then E13.

FLAKE RESOLVED 2026-07-07: TestHungRunHoldsLane scheduling race fixed in PR #64: https://github.com/MateusAMP2119/iris-engine-cli/pull/64 (commit 846acb0, test pacing waits on hung-run start too, ctx-bounded); duplicate fix branch discarded. Root cause: pacing loop exited on live lane's 3rd pass alone. Stress-validated (0/200 under CPU load in the parallel investigation).

RESOLVED 2026-07-07: shutdownfix (linux CI pidfile timeout) landed as PR #51: https://github.com/MateusAMP2119/iris-engine-cli/pull/51; KNOWN CI-RED note retired. REVIEW PAUSE lifted by user 2026-07-07 ("finish my BUILD_STATE tasks", parallelism cap removed, Fable 5 agents instead of coder agent, orchestrator self-review instead of Greptile — tokens spent).

SESSION B DEAD ~14:41 (all four worktrees went write-silent simultaneously; user closed it). SESSION A owns everything again. E08.2 review-fix harvested → PR #68. E06.7/E09.5/E12.2 resumed in-place by fresh A agents (15:0x) continuing B's partial state.

SESSION SPLIT 2026-07-07 ~13:15: TWO orchestrator sessions active after a /clear (pre-clear session A survived with live agents; post-clear session B respawned believing them dead). Current ownership — session A: E09.5 (worktree live), PR/merge duties it already took (#64 merged, #65 opened). Session B: E06.6 (coder finishing conformance verify inside the worktree; B's diff review of PR #65: https://github.com/MateusAMP2119/iris-engine-cli/pull/65 done, approve pending that green), E08.2, E11.3 (coders live in worktrees). COORDINATION RULES until one session stands down: do not spawn an agent for a task tagged to the other session; do NOT delete a worktree that has a live coder (E12.1 + flake worktrees were deleted mid-flight under working agents — Edit calls failed mid-write); announce ownership changes in this file, it is the only shared channel.

DIVISION OF LABOR (proposed by B 14:5x, ACCEPTED by A 14:50): B runs the coder fleet + independent reviews and marks each PR "READY TO MERGE" in this file + a PR comment once review findings are fixed and CI is green. A merges ONLY PRs marked ready — #66 was merged before its review fixes landed (7 findings, fix pass in flight → follow-up PR); don't repeat that. B's live coders right now: E06.7, E12.2, E09.5 (all fresh tasks, no duplicates), plus the E08.2 review-fix pass. E11.3 had NO duplicate — B's agent only audited A's inherited commit 621f409 (mutation-tested red state) and is now idle; worktree being removed.

SCHEMA-FK DEBT (E05.9 flag, resolve when live prune path wired): run_inputs.upstream_run_id -> runs.id is a plain FK (schema.go ~176, no ON DELETE). Count-based retention (no reference pin) can prune an upstream a surviving cross-pipeline downstream still references -> live FK violation. Composite PK forbids SET NULL; spec §4(FK) vs §6.2(no pin) tension. Likely fix: make it FK-free (like data_journal.run_id S04/journal-run-id-not-fk) or ON DELETE CASCADE. Latent until dispatcher prune loop runs live.

GRANT DEBT (E04.3/E04.4 follow-up): for capture to fire, pipeline roles need USAGE ON SCHEMA iris + EXECUTE ON iris.capture() (E06.2 conformance grants them explicitly; journal write itself runs as owner via SECURITY DEFINER). Add the iris-schema execute grant to grant-reconcile. Also E06.2 flags: data-PAT/pipeline reaching iris.capture() needs those grants.

DAEMON WIRING DEBT (track, close in E05.12 + a daemon-routes pass): several control-plane
routes are defined CLI-side + proven at unit/integration/stub-conformance tier but NOT
wired into the live daemon perpetual loop yet: apply/destroy (E03.10, wired), deadletter
replay (E05.7, CLI+stub only), manual run (E05.10). The lane-runner perpetual pass loop
(E05.12) + a daemon-routes pass must connect these. Contracts are proven at tier; the
end-to-end daemon path is the integration closure. E05.7 CLI↔leader wire shape
(POST /deadletter/replay → {data:{replayed,dead_lettered}}) is provisional — formalize in
internal/api when the route lands. E11.3 adds: production Run() wires neither
WithInflightKiller nor WithFreshSessions — wire BOTH together (else standby re-entry
silently breaks) alongside the lane loop + a store.Client session-renewal seam (E11.4).
NEW FLAKE (track): daemon TestLanePassCounterLeaderTerm/S11/lane-pass-counter-reset (E12.1) — counter read raced leader-change reset once on linux Go 1.26 CI (PR #70: https://github.com/MateusAMP2119/iris-engine-cli/pull/70); 30/30 green under -race locally; rerun passed. If it repeats, fix = wait on demotion completion before Counts assert.
E08.2 adds: WithBuildPlane/WithPipelinePlane/WithControlPlane silently overwrite shared
option fields (workspace/manualReader/runner) — last wins, no error; buildplane clear()
blocks new builds but doesn't stop in-flight ones (mirrors manual-run plane pattern).

Worktrees: `../iris-worktrees/EXX.Y` on branch `issue/EXX.Y-short-name`.

RECONCILED 2026-07-07 07:xx: PRs #27 (E03.2 lanes) + #33 (test flake fix) had silently NOT merged despite chains reporting success (API-instability window) — merged into development by hand (commits 6afe150, e131edd); development green, daemon race-clean x3. AUDIT LESSON: verify each merge landed (grep a signature file on origin/development) before marking done; don't trust merge-when-green.sh exit alone.

## E00 Conformance Harness and Traceability Gate — epic PR: #6 (merged)

Post-epic deep review (multi-agent, orchestrator-run per user instruction) produced
review-fix PRs #7 (CI/lint/conformance), #8 (gate hardening, 3 rounds), #9 (exec
runner rebuilt on stdlib os/exec + WaitDelay, 3 rounds) — all reviewed to zero
confirmed findings and merged. Standing rule: every PR gets the Opus pr-review
workflow (.claude/workflows/pr-review.js) before merge; on stall, kill + restart on
Opus, never downgrade.
