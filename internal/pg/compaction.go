// This file is the pure model of the seal-time journal compaction rule: the
// clockless, count-based transformation a seal applies to a partition's rows before
// it checkpoints them. CompactJournalRange (live.go) is the SQL realization of
// exactly this rule against a sealed id range; CompactEntries is the same rule
// expressed as pure Go so the collapse contract is unit-testable without a live
// database.
//
// The rule has two halves, and one invariant:
//
//   - Pre-images past undo eligibility are nulled. An entry keeps its pre-image
//     only while it is still undo-open (a wipe could still replay it); once past
//     undo (promoted, wiped, or skipped) the pre-image can never be replayed, so it
//     is dropped. A sealed partition is immutable by construction and holds no
//     undo-open entries, so the SQL realization nulls every pre-image in the sealed
//     range -- a special case of this rule.
//   - Duplicate stamps per (schema, table, row_pk, run_id) collapse to the latest
//     op: within one such key, only the highest-id entry survives (the last write
//     that run made to that row), carrying its op.
//   - Invariant: each run's exact write set survives. Every distinct
//     (schema, table, row_pk, run_id) key that had any entry still has exactly one
//     after compaction, so provenance returns the same per-run write set -- lineage
//     is never lost, only redundant intermediate stamps and un-replayable
//     pre-images are dropped.

// CompactEntries applies the seal-time compaction collapse rule to entries and
// returns the compacted set in id order: pre-images past undo eligibility nulled,
// duplicate stamps per (schema, table, row_pk, run_id) folded to the latest op
// (highest id), with each key's exact surviving write preserved. It does not mutate
// the input slice, so a caller may reuse it.
