// This file owns the pure wipe model: the algorithm behind `iris workload wipe
// [<pipeline>]` and behind declare destroy's data revert. It plans a wipe
// entirely over in-memory journal rows -- no
// SQL is built or executed here; a later task feeds the plan to the data
// database in one transaction (journal and tables co-reside: no partial wipe).
// Keeping the algorithm pure keeps every rule unit-testable and keeps the live
// executor a dumb interpreter of an already-decided plan.
//
// The rules modeled, in the order the plan applies them:
//
//   - Scope. Wipe scope is exactly the journal entries still undo = 'open':
//     written under disposable data_mode and unreleased by promotion (promotion
//     flips open entries to 'promoted'; permanent-mode writes are born 'promoted';
//     earlier wipes leave 'wiped' or 'skipped'). Everything outside 'open' is
//     provenance memory only, and no operation in this model -- or anywhere --
//     re-arms it.
//
//   - Reverse replay. Scope entries replay in reverse id order: a disposable
//     insert reverts by deleting the row, a wipe-eligible update or delete by
//     restoring its captured pre-image. Reverse order is what unwinds same-row
//     stacking inside the scope: journal ids per (schema, table, row_pk) are
//     strictly commit-ordered (the trigger fires in the writing transaction), so
//     replaying newest-first rewinds a contested row layer by layer to its
//     pre-scope state.
//
//   - Conflict skip. An open entry is conflict-skipped, its row left as-is,
//     whenever a later journal entry exists for the same (schema, table, row_pk)
//     whose write is still in the row's value. The check is journal-internal with
//     no image comparison -- every write is captured, so it is total -- and "still
//     in the row's value" is decidable from undo alone: 'promoted', 'skipped', and
//     out-of-scope 'open' writes are in the value; a 'wiped' write is not. Later
//     same-scope entries never conflict: replay visits them first, retiring them
//     to 'wiped', which is exactly why the replay runs in reverse. The report
//     names the conflicting run: the nearest later still-in-value entry's run, the
//     write that sits immediately on top of the skipped one.
//
//   - Retirement. Every visited open entry is retired: reverted ones to 'wiped',
//     conflict-skipped ones to 'skipped'. Retired entries leave the wipe scope, so
//     conflicts are reported once and never re-visited, and the summary reports
//     both counts.
//
//   - Pipeline narrowing. A named wipe narrows the scope to one pipeline's journal
//     entries -- attributed through the run that wrote them -- leaving other
//     pipelines' open entries untouched; a bare wipe covers the whole scope.
//     Declare destroy's data revert is exactly the narrowed form
//     (PlanDestroyRevert delegates to PlanWipe).
//
//   - Cursor rides along. A pipeline's source cursor lives in a declared table it
//     writes, so a run's cursor-advance is a journaled write like any other and
//     needs no special case here: wiping the run restores the pre-advance cursor
//     row in the same plan as the run's data, so the next pass reprocesses exactly
//     the reverted window and never silently skips it. That the cursor is handled
//     by NOT being special is the point: an engine-held cursor field would be
//     unattributed and unrevertible.
//
// Sealed partitions are out of reach by construction: a partition seals only
// with zero open entries (partition.go), so the wipe scope always lives entirely
// in unsealed partitions and this model never needs to know about sealing.

// UndoState is a journal entry's undo lifecycle state: the data_journal.undo
// value set, mirrored here so the wipe model and the journal DDL agree.
