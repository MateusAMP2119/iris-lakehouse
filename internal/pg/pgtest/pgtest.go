// Package pgtest provides a recording fake of the data database client seam
// (internal/pg). The Recorder captures every statement issued through the pg
// interface, in order, so a test can drive the real DDL/grant reconcile code and
// then diff the captured CREATE / ALTER / GRANT and trigger DDL byte-for-byte
// against golden files -- with no live Postgres (S16/integration-fakes-interfaces).
// A golden diff is a contract diff.
//
// This is test-support infrastructure imported only by _test.go files. It is the
// seam by which E03/E04 prove their generated DDL: build a Recorder, issue the
// schema's statements through it, then pass Dump to internal/golden.Assert.
