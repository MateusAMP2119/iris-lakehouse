// This file models the data journal's id-range partitioning (specification
// sections 4 and 14). data_journal is declared PARTITION BY RANGE (id); its rows
// are carved into partitions by a count-based threshold, journal_partition_rows
// (default 10M, configurable). The threshold is not an exact cap: a partition
// seals only once it holds at least the threshold's worth of rows AND every
// in-flight run writing into it has finished AND it holds zero open entries.
//
// Two invariants follow and are modeled here. First, a run's journal window never
// splits across partitions: because a seal waits for in-flight runs to finish, a
// partition boundary always lands at or beyond every open run's ceiling, so a
// run's stamps share one partition (else per-run compaction would break). Second,
// wipe and promote touch only unsealed partitions: sealed history is immutable by
// construction.
//
// The DDL rendered here (PARTITION OF ... FOR VALUES FROM ... TO ...) is
// deterministic, so a golden diff is a contract diff. Sealing, compaction, and
// checkpointing the sealed partitions is downstream (E07); this file owns only the
// partition shape and the boundary-placement rule.

// Partition is one id-range partition of public.data_journal: the half-open id
// window it holds and whether it has sealed. Journal ids are a monotonic bigint
// identity starting at 1, so 0 is never a valid id and marks an unbounded end:
// From == 0 renders MINVALUE (the very first partition's lower bound) and To == 0
// renders MAXVALUE (the open, unsealed tail new stamps land in). A sealed
// partition is immutable by construction (specification section 14).
