// This file is the depends_on eligibility gate and its consumption decision.
// depends_on is a data gate, not an order: it makes a downstream pipeline eligible
// only on an upstream's output and never sequences the two -- ordering is the
// composer's job alone. The gate here is a pure decision at the dependent's
// composer-assigned turn: for each depends_on edge it reads the upstream's most
// recent run and the run_inputs already-consumed check, produces the per-edge verdict
// from a closed set, and composes the pass decision (run, consuming one upstream run
// per edge, or skip, minting no run row). It reads only the
// upstream's LATEST run -- older successes are superseded, not queued -- holds no
// cursor or watermark of its own, and carries no walk-position or lane field, so it
// can neither reorder the walk nor turn a cross-lane reference into a serial
// ordering.
//
// The consumption write itself is not here: on an open gate the dispatcher feeds the
// decision's Consume list to store.Writer.CreateRun, which records one run_inputs row
// per consumed upstream in the same atomic run-create transaction, written once at
// run start and never mutated. This file owns the decision and the 1:1 recording
// rule; CreateRun owns the write.

// UpstreamState is the disposition of an upstream's most recent run -- the only run
// the gate reads ("the gate reads only the upstream's latest run"). Older runs are
// superseded, never buffered, so this single latest disposition, not a backlog, is
