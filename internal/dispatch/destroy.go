package dispatch

// This file is the declaration destroy op: the leader-side path that tears down one
// declared unit. A pipeline destroy reverts the target's un-promoted disposable data,
// then retires all of its meta rows in one atomic transaction (the pipelines row
// last) through the single meta writer, then deletes its object-store bytes. A
// composer destroy clears the lane's rows, but only once the lane has at most one
// registered member -- the mirror of apply's 2+ invariant. This is the dispatch-level
// surface; the CLI and daemon control-connection wiring that drives it is wired at
// the daemon layer.
//
// The teardown's side effects ride four seams, each supplied by the daemon's
// leader wiring (leadership.go) and defaulting to open/no-op only for
// compositions that wire none (shape tests):
//
//   - DataReverter reverts the target's un-promoted disposable data before any
//     meta row is retired: the daemon adapts the journal-driven reverse-replay
//     (pg.Client.ExecuteWipe, scoped to the target with live run attribution).
//   - RunLister feeds the two pre-retirement reads: the remaining runs in
//     archival shape (their run_summaries rows are written inside the retirement
//     transaction, so pruned lineage never dangles) and the artifact-hash census.
//   - ObjectDeleter deletes the target's content-addressed object-store bytes
//     (the artifact FILES; the artifact meta ROWS ride the retirement
//     transaction) after the retirement commits, from the pre-read hash list.
//   - DestroyBlocker is the downstream-blocker predicate set (a registered
//     pipeline depends_on the target, a run_inputs row names its runs, a
//     dead-letter entry names it as failed_upstream). The predicates are pure in
//     destructive.go (DestroyBlockReasons); the daemon feeds them in over live
//     meta snapshots (Candidate.destroyBlocker), and no flag overrides a refusal.
