package dispatch

// This file is the declaration destroy op: the leader-side path that tears down one
// declared unit (specification section 12, destructive ops item 1). A pipeline
// destroy reverts the target's un-promoted disposable data, then retires all of its
// meta rows in one atomic transaction (the pipelines row last) through the single
// meta writer, then deletes its object-store bytes. A composer destroy clears the
// lane's rows, but only once the lane has at most one registered member -- the mirror
// of apply's 2+ invariant. This is the dispatch-level surface; the CLI and daemon
// control-connection wiring that drives it is wired at the daemon layer.
//
// Three seams are deliberately open here, each documented rather than silently
// stubbed, because the behavior they gate belongs to a later epic:
//
//   - DataReverter reverts the target's un-promoted disposable data. The real
//     journal-driven reverse-replay is E06; today a no-op seam (or a test recorder)
//     stands in, invoked as a recorded step before the meta teardown so the flow and
//     its ordering are proven now and E06 fills only the body.
//   - ObjectDeleter deletes the target's content-addressed object-store bytes (the
//     artifact FILES; the artifact meta ROWS ride the retirement transaction). The
//     real content-addressed deletion is E05/E07; a no-op seam stands in now.
//   - DestroyBlocker is the downstream-blocker predicate set (a registered pipeline
//     depends_on the target, a run_inputs row names its runs, a dead-letter entry
//     names it as failed_upstream). Those predicates are E10.1's; the seam here
//     defaults OPEN (never blocks), so E10.1 supplies the guard without touching this
//     teardown action.
//
// The archival-summary write (each remaining run's run_summaries row, written in the
// retirement transaction so pruned lineage never dangles) is likewise deferred to
// E05/E07's archival tier; store.Writer.RetirePipeline documents that omission.
