// idleReadInterval bounds how long the perpetual loop waits before re-reading the
// walk while WHOLLY idle (no lane running). It is not a dispatch timer and gates
// nothing on a clock: the running path is event-driven on pass completions and
// meta-change wakes (clock doctrine), and this bounded wait only wakes an
// otherwise-idle loop as a safety net -- a graph change whose bump was somehow
// missed, or a composition with no Events wired, is picked up promptly rather
// than never. With the watermark wired, an idle iteration is the doctrine's
// accepted hot idle loop kept cheap: the walk read alone, no gate evaluation and
// no run for any parked lane.
const idleReadInterval = 250 * time.Millisecond

// This file is the perpetual lane loop: the leader-owned dispatch runtime that turns
// the persisted walk into runs. It composes the lane walk (lane.go's BuildWalk, one
// goroutine per lane), the depends_on gate (gate.go, pass eligibility), and the
// run-start seam (run.go's RunManager, behind FreshRunner) into the pass semantics
// the engine runs forever once a leader wins the lock.
//
// Pass semantics:
//   - One goroutine per lane, a perpetual per-lane loop. Distinct lanes run in
//     parallel with no engine cap; a laneless pipeline is its own lane (BuildWalk).
//   - The loop is watermark-parked (events.go): a lane re-passes only when the
//     meta-change sequence advanced since its last pass started -- every
//     engine-visible cause bumps it through the single dispatcher -- so an idle
//     graph dispatches nothing and costs nothing beyond the bounded walk re-read.
//     Root (edge-less) pipelines are gated on their declaration (rootgate.go), so
//     a pass on an unchanged graph starts no run: no loop run without an
//     unconsumed cause.
//   - Each pass reads the walk at pass start (a snapshot): a graph change mid-pass
//     lands only at the next pass, and an in-flight run is never touched. A removed
//     pipeline finishes its current run, then stops appearing.
//   - Within a lane, members are dispatched serially in composer order (member N+1
//     starts only after member N reaches a terminal state), each open-gated one as a
//     FRESH run on current data (cause=loop). A failed run is never retried or backed
//     off; re-execution is only ever an explicit replay. A run failure is isolated:
//     it never gates the walk, never stops the loop, and never blocks another lane.
//   - A hung run holds its lane indefinitely (no engine timeout -- clock doctrine):
//     the lane's next pipeline waits, and only an operator cancel frees it; other
//     lanes keep dispatching.
//   - Dispatcher-owned bookkeeping (failure propagation, replay, snapshot pin,
//     pruning, journal lifecycle) runs opportunistically AFTER a lane pass completes,
//     never mid-pass.

// WalkReader reads the current lane walk from meta. The loop calls it once at each
// pass's start, so the pass runs on that snapshot even if the graph changes mid-pass:
// an in-flight pass finishes on the old graph and the next pass reads the new one. A
// meta-backed implementation (lane rows plus the registered-pipeline set, fed through
// BuildWalk) and a fake both satisfy it.

// run, and a poisoned gate defers to post-pass failure propagation. The loop
// evaluates it at each member's turn -- after the previous same-lane member reached
