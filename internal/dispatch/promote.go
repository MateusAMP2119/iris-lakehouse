// This file is the promote op: the leader-side path behind `iris pipeline
// promote <name>` (specification sections 1, 5, and 12). Promotion marks a
// pipeline's data permanent, and it is gated on built: the flip is refused
// whenever the pipeline is not in built state, so a source-only pipeline can
// never hold permanent data (the same blocked matrix cell
// store.ValidateModeMatrix and pg.PermanentRequiresBuilt enforce at their own
// boundaries -- the gate here reuses pg.PermanentRequiresBuilt so the rule can
// never drift). An admitted promote has exactly two effects, in order: the
// journal-side marker flip on the data database (open entries retired to
// promoted; internal/pg's promote.go owns that model, reached through the
// JournalPromoter seam), then the per-pipeline data_mode flip in meta through
// the single writer -- the control truth wipe scope is decided from. Nothing is
// copied, moved, or deleted; capture and provenance continue unchanged.
//
// Promote also repeats the cross-mode read warning apply raised: while any
// depends_on upstream is still in disposable data_mode, the outcome carries one
// advisory warning per such upstream (specification section 5: legitimate
// mid-promotion; warn, never refuse). The warnings are computed by the same
// declare.CheckCrossModeReads rule apply uses, over the upstream data modes
// read from meta, so apply and promote can never disagree on the warning.
