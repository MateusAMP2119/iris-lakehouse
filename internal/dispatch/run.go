// This file is the run-start/cancel seam: the dispatcher-side glue that turns a
// declared run into a started subprocess and records its lifecycle through the
// single meta writer (specification section 1). Starting a run is a direct exec in
// the pipeline folder, in its own process group, with the composed environment;
// cancelling one kills that group and dead-letters the run as stopped, touching
// nothing else. It never imposes a timeout: a run ends only by exiting on its own or
// by explicit cancellation (specification section 6.3 clock doctrine).

// DBConnEnvVar is the environment variable through which the engine injects a run's
// scoped database connection URL (specification section 1: env = inherited + declared
// + injected scoped DB connection). It is the documented seam the real per-pipeline
// scoped connection (E04.4) later populates; today StartRun injects RunSpec.DBURL
// under this name so a run can already resolve its connection from a single place.

// ErrRunNotInFlight reports that no in-flight run has the given id: it has already
// exited, was already cancelled, or was never started through this manager. Cancel
// acts only on a live run, so a caller learns its cancel found nothing to kill rather
// than silently dead-lettering a run that already finished.
