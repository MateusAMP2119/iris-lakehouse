// This file is the run-start/cancel seam: the dispatcher-side glue that turns a
// declared run into a started subprocess and records its lifecycle through the single
// meta writer. Starting a run is a direct exec in the pipeline folder, in its own
// process group, with the composed environment; cancelling one kills that group and
// dead-letters the run as stopped, touching nothing else. It never imposes a timeout:
// a run ends only by exiting on its own or by explicit cancellation.

// DBConnEnvVar is the environment variable through which the engine injects a run's
// scoped database connection URL (env = inherited + declared + injected scoped DB
// connection). StartRun injects RunSpec.DBURL under this name, with the run's id
// riding it as the iris.run_id session setting, so a run resolves its connection
// from a single place. The daemon supplies each run's PIPELINE-SCOPED connection:
// the pipeline's own least-privilege login role (pg.ProvisionPipelineRole at
// declare apply, credential persisted in store's roles/grants/credentials
// ledger), so Postgres enforces the declared access for the run's own writes.

// ErrRunNotInFlight reports that no in-flight run has the given id: it has already
// exited, was already cancelled, or was never started through this manager. Cancel
// acts only on a live run, so a caller learns its cancel found nothing to kill rather
// than silently dead-lettering a run that already finished.
