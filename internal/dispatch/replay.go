package dispatch

// This file is the pure dead-letter replay logic: the worklist-exit model, the
// failed_upstream root walk, the self-supersession rule, and the dead-lettering
// replay signal. It is pure -- no I/O, no meta access -- so replay's decisions are a
// function of the worklist alone: which entry is a root cause, which propagated entry
// walks to which root, which propagated entry has already superseded itself, and
// whether a replay batch re-dead-lettered (the condition the replay command maps to
// exit 5). The write that mints the fresh replacement run and removes the replaced
// entry is store.ReplayRun; this file owns only the decision the dispatcher feeds it.
