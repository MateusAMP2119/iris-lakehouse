// This file is the drain write: the single-writer path that disposes of scoped
// dead-lettered runs by pure discard. Unlike replay, drain mints nothing and
// touches no other table: it deletes exactly the scoped runs' dead_letters
// worklist rows, one atomic statement, and nothing else -- no re-run, no
// downstream alteration. The run rows themselves stay in runs (a worklist exit
// never deletes run history); with no outstanding dead_letters entry left,
// count-based retention (dispatch.SelectPrunable, which spares any run its
// worklist entry still holds) reads the run as prunable, and -- because the
// removed entry was the run's only replay ticket -- the run can never be replayed
// again (ResolveReplayTargets finds no worklist entry for it and errors). The
// dispatcher resolves which run ids the operator's scope names
// (internal/dispatch, ResolveDrainTargets) and hands the resolved list here to
// write.

// drainDeadLettersSQL discards the dead_letters worklist rows for exactly the given
// run ids, scoped-only: no other row, and no other table, is touched by this
// statement.

// DrainDeadLetters discards the dead_letters worklist rows for runIDs in one

// downstream is altered (no run_inputs insert) -- the runs rows stay exactly as
// they were, so a drained run becomes prunable and can never be replayed
// afterward (its dead_letters entry, the only replay ticket, is gone). An empty
// runIDs issues no statement: draining nothing changes nothing. It is a
// leader-only meta write, riding the single Writer through the atomic ExecTx path
// (a connection without it fails loudly rather than splitting the drain across
// un-atomic Execs).
