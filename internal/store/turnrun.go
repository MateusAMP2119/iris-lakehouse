// This file is the turn-protocol run-record write surface (#206). Under the turn
// protocol a loop run's record is minted only when its turn produces something to
// record: a producing turn mints a RUNNING run just before its data transaction
// (so a crash between the two leaves a running row for reconciliation, never data
// without a record) and completes it with the turn's stamps after; a failed turn
// mints its run directly dead-lettered with the worklist row in the same atomic
// statement; a quiet turn mints nothing at all. Every method rides the single
// Writer like the rest of the run-record path.

// TurnRunRecord is the input to the turn-run mints: the run identity fields a
// turn carries when it records.
