// This file is the PAT authentication read surface: the plain-MVCC meta read that
// resolves a token prefix (pats.id) to the durable record a bearer-token verifier
// checks -- the argon2id hash, the revoked flag, the
// scope-row union, and, for a data-scope PAT, the engine-managed read role it owns
// (roles.pat -> pg_role). It is a read, never a write, so it rides the reader pool
// on any node (a standby authenticates TCP reads exactly as the leader does). The
// raw token never appears here: the verifier hashes the presented token and
// compares against the stored hash; this read carries only the stored hash out.

// ErrPATNotFound is returned by LookupPAT when no pats row matches the token
// prefix: the token names a PAT that was never minted (or its prefix is garbage).
// The verifier maps it to a 401, indistinguishable to the caller from a bad
// secret. Callers test it with errors.Is.
