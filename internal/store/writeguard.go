// This file is the lock-guarded meta write connection: the enforcement of the
// failover single-writer rule that meta writes are never issued over a session
// that has not re-acquired the leader lock. On the live path the rule is physical
// -- the single write connection IS the lock-holding session (client.go), so a
// dead session fails its writes at Postgres -- but physics alone does not refuse a
// write issued before the lock is acquired, or one racing a demotion.
// LockGuardedConn closes that: it wraps the write connection and consults the
// leader lock before EVERY statement, refusing with ErrNoLeaderLock unless this
// session currently holds the lock. A deposed leader's session never re-acquires
// (re-acquisition happens only on a fresh session), so its guard refuses forever:
// across a failover there is no second writer and no overlapping run. The same
// guard runs over the meta-store fake, which is how the rule is proven at
// integration tier with no live Postgres.

// ErrNoLeaderLock is returned when a meta write is refused because the session it
// would ride does not currently hold the leader lock: the session never acquired
// it, released it, or died and was deposed. The write never reaches meta.

// over a live session and a scripted one.
