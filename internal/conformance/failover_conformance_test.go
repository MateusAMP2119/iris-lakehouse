// This file is the live-daemon failover leg of specification section 15 (E11.4):
// two real daemon candidates share ONE meta (the external cluster's single meta
// database), so exactly one holds the leader advisory lock and the other blocks on
// it as a standby. Killing the leader process abruptly (a host-loss simulation, not
// a graceful stop) drops the leader's Postgres session, releasing the session-level
// advisory lock, and the blocked standby's pg_advisory_lock returns: it acquires,
// runs startup reconciliation, and becomes the dispatching leader. It needs a shared
// external Postgres (IRIS_PG_DSN); managed mode gives each daemon its OWN Postgres,
// so there is no shared lock to contend for.

// waitForRole polls a daemon's /healthz until it reports want or the deadline
// passes. Readiness is the reported role (a condition), never elapsed time; the poll
// interval only keeps the loop from spinning.
