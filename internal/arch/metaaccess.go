// CLI has no path to a database. Every state change the CLI requests is executed by
// the leader daemon over the control connection, so the CLI process never opens a
// connection to meta or the data database -- it holds neither database client. The
// daemon (which the CLI dials over the socket) holds store (meta) and pg (data);
// the CLI reaching meta through the daemon is exactly the design, but the CLI
// importing store or pg itself would give it a direct database path, which this
// check forbids.

// (store or pg): a direct path to meta the CLI must never have.
