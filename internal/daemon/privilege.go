// This file holds the startup privilege check for the admin DSN. Before any lane
// runs, the daemon validates that the admin role the DSN authenticates as holds
// the privileges the engine needs (specification section 2): CREATEROLE (to mint
// pipeline and data-PAT roles), CREATEDB (to create the meta database), and
// ownership of every managed schema. Superuser is never required — a plain role
// with those grants passes — and a superuser is accepted, not demanded. A missing
// privilege fails fast, naming what is missing, so a misconfigured DSN is caught
// at startup rather than mid-run.

// PrivilegeQuery is the catalog query the real reader runs to snapshot the admin
// role's cluster privileges: the current session role's CREATEROLE, CREATEDB, and
// superuser bits from pg_roles. rolsuper is selected only so the check can accept
// a superuser; it is never a requirement. The pgx-backed reader that runs this
// query lands in E02.3; the check logic here is proven with a scripted fake.
