// a Postgres session advisory lock: a candidate blocks acquiring it (standby),
// and the acquire returns only when it wins (leader). On winning, the candidate
// starts the single dispatcher goroutine, re-checks the meta schema through it
// (the leader-only write at election, specification section 4), and reports the
// leader role so its listeners accept mutations. Standbys reject mutations and
// serve reads. Connection death releases the lock and promotes the next standby;
// E11 drives the failover consequences (self-demotion, dead-lettering) -- E02.6
// lands the election and the single-writer path it gates.

// Candidate is one daemon candidate for leadership. Serve blocks it as a standby
// until it acquires the leader lock, then runs it as the leader (sole dispatcher)
// until its context is cancelled or its lock session is lost.
