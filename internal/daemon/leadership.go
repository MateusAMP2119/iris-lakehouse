// This file is leader election and the leadership transitions around it: the step
// that turns a daemon candidate into the one leader, the sole dispatcher, and the
// step that takes leadership away again (specification sections 2 and 15).
// Leadership is a Postgres session advisory lock: a candidate blocks acquiring it
// (standby), and the acquire returns only when it wins (leader). On winning, the
// candidate starts the single dispatcher goroutine, re-checks the meta schema
// through it (the leader-only write at election, specification section 4), runs
// startup reconciliation -- identical on cold start and failover promotion, so a
// newly promoted daemon reconciles exactly as a restarted one does -- and reports
// the leader role so its listeners accept mutations. Standbys reject mutations
// and serve reads.
//
// Losing the meta session is the other transition (E11.3). Connection death
// releases the lock at Postgres and promotes the next standby, but connection
// death is not process death: the deposed daemon must demote ITSELF, explicitly
// and at once -- stop dispatching (the lane loop is halted before anything else),
// kill its in-flight runs (their records are the new leader's to dead-letter; the
// new leader cannot reach the processes across hosts, so the kill is this side's
// duty), and re-enter standby on a FRESH session, because a dead Postgres session
// can never re-acquire the lock and its write guard refuses forever.

// Candidate is one daemon candidate for leadership. Serve blocks it as a standby
// until it acquires the leader lock, then runs it as the leader (sole dispatcher)
// until its context is cancelled or its lock session is lost.
