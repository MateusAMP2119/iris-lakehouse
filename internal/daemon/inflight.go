// This file is the daemon-held in-flight run registry: the production
// InflightKiller the self-demotion kill acts through. A daemon that loses its meta
// session stops dispatching and kills its in-flight runs at once, writing NOTHING
// to meta (a deposed session cannot carry a meta write, and the runs' records are
// the new leader's to dead-letter). The dispatch.RunManager satisfies
// InflightKiller for the lane-loop path; the manual `iris pipeline run` path runs
// subprocesses directly (not through a RunManager), so this registry gives those
// runs the same in-flight visibility, tracking each live process-group handle from
// start until reap.

// inflightRuns tracks the daemon's live manual-run process-group handles by run id,
// so a self-demotion can SIGKILL every one of them at once. It satisfies
// InflightKiller. Access is guarded because the manual orchestrator tracks and
// untracks from run goroutines while the election goroutine may fire the kill.
