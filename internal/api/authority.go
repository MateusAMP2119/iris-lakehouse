// This file is the request-authority model of the read API (specification
// section 7): who a request acts as, and which scope each route demands. The
// two transports resolve authority differently -- a unix-socket request is
// ambient (local, filesystem-guarded: full authority, no token), while a TCP
// request's bearer token resolves to the PAT's minted scopes -- but the mux
// checks every route against one Authority regardless of transport, so the
// scope split (a data-only PAT sees no engine internals, a read-only PAT no
// table data, control mutations demand control) is enforced in exactly one
// place. api imports pat (a leaf) for the closed scope set only.

// Authority is what a request is allowed to do: the resolved PAT identity and
// its minted scopes, or the ambient authority a unix-socket request carries.
// The zero value is deliberately powerless (no scopes, not ambient): only
// RequirePAT (a verified token) or the socket default grants authority.

	// for a PAT without the data scope and for ambient authority (an ambient
	// read runs as the engine itself).
