// This file is the daemon's process-status surface: GET /ps, the one payload
// `iris ps` prints. It is the docker-ps-shaped readout of the engine: what the
// engine is (version, role, pid), what it is doing (the run rows, queued and
// running by default, the whole history under ?all=true), and what it costs the
// host (the sampled CPU and resident-memory load of the engine's own process
// group and of each running run's process group). It is a read, served on any
// role, so a remote client with a read PAT sees the same readout the local
// socket does.
//
// Load is a best-effort host sample: when the daemon cannot probe its host
// (an exotic platform, a stripped container), the load fields are null rather
// than fabricated zeros -- absence is honest, zero is a claim. Uptime keeps the
// engine's display-only wall-clock doctrine: a rendered string, never a
